## Overview
FicFeed has two components: the front-end app and the notification server.
- App:
	- Written in Swift.
	- Uses CocoaPods.
	- Depends on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [MWFeedParser](https://github.com/mwaterfall/MWFeedParser).
- Server:
	- Written in Python.
	- Depends on [PyFCM](https://github.com/olucurious/PyFCM) and [feedparser](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser).

## What does it do?
- Browse ~400 fandom tags and view the 25 newest works in each (pulled from each tagâ€™s RSS feed).
- Read works in the app using a WKWebView.
- Track/untrack tags to receive notifications about new works.
	- This is courtesy of the notification server, which iterates through all the tags, checking their RSS feeds for anything new, and sends notifications to topics corresponding to each tag. All this is executed regularly on a fixed schedule.
- More features to come in future versions.

## Notes
The API key in the notification server, as well as `GoogleServices-Info.plist` have been omitted. Additionally, text files that the notification server uses have been omitted for practicality (or lack thereof).
